\section{Training utilities} \label{sec:training-utilities}

The most useful function provided by the \mono{trainutils.py} module is\\\mono{train\_test\_split}. This function takes as input two tensors (input data and target data) and splits them into training and test sets.

Other notable functions include \mono{normalize\_features} and\\\mono{denormalize\_features}, which are used to normalize and denormalize the input and target features, respectively; \mono{one\_hot\_encode} and \mono{one\_hot\_decode}, which are used to convert categorical labels into one-hot encoded vectors and vice versa; and \mono{accuracy}, which computes the accuracy of predictions for classification tasks, i.e., the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of samples.
