\part{Implementation of \mfnet}

\section{Basic Data Structure}

The fundamental data structure in \mfnet is the Tensor. In this context, a Tensor is simply a \mono{numpy}
array with a fixed data type of \mono{numpy.float64}. 

Tensors are used throughout \mfnet to represent inputs, outputs, intermediate activations, weights, and
gradients within the neural network.
