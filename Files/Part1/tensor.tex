\part{Implementation of \texttt{mfnet}}

\section{Basic Data Structure}

The fundamental data structure in \texttt{mfnet} is the Tensor. In this context, a Tensor is simply a \texttt{numpy}
array with a fixed data type of \texttt{numpy.float64}. 

Tensors are used throughout \texttt{mfnet} to represent inputs, outputs, intermediate activations, weights, and
gradients within the neural network.
