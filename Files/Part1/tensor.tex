\part{Implementation of \mfnet}

This first part will describe the implementation details of the \mfnet library.

All the code for this project is available on \href{https://www.github.com/marchfra/mfnet}{GitHub}.

\section{Basic Data Structure}

The fundamental data structure in \mfnet is the Tensor. In this context, a Tensor is simply a \mono{numpy}
array with a fixed data type of \mono{numpy.float64}. 

Tensors are used throughout \mfnet to represent inputs, outputs, intermediate activations, weights, and
gradients within the \acl{NN}.
